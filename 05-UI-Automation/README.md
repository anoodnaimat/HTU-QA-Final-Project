## UI Automation

### Overview
This section covers UI automation testing performed to validate the core
functionalities of a web application using automated test scripts.
The objective is to ensure correct UI behavior, improve test reliability,
and reduce repetitive manual testing.

---

### Application Under Test
- Application Name: SauceDemo
- Application URL: https://www.saucedemo.com/
- Application Type: Web Application
- Testing Type: UI Automation Testing

---

### Test Objectives
- Automate core functional user scenarios
- Validate UI behavior and user workflows
- Reduce repetitive manual testing effort
- Ensure repeatable and reliable test execution

---

### Automation Scope
The UI automation suite provides at least 8 automated test scenarios,
covering core UI functionalities such as:
- User login with valid credentials
- User login with invalid credentials
- Navigation through the application
- Interaction with UI elements (buttons, forms, lists)
- Validation of expected UI behavior using assertions

---

### Automation Framework
- UI automation tests are implemented using an automation framework.
- The automation project includes:
  - Automated UI test scripts
  - Assertions for UI validation
  - Supporting configuration files

---

### Test Execution
- UI tests are executed automatically through the automation framework.
- Assertions are used to verify:
  - Visibility and presence of UI elements
  - Correct navigation between pages
  - Expected results after user actions
- Test execution results indicate pass or fail status for each test.

---

### How to Run the Tests
- Open the UI automation project.
- Install the required dependencies.
- Run the automated test suite using the test runner.
- Test results will be displayed after execution.

This represents a local scripted execution of the UI automation suite.

---

### Automation Evidence
- Automated UI tests are executed locally.
- Test execution confirms that the automation suite is working correctly.
- The project demonstrates a runnable UI automation setup with multiple automated tests.

---

### Files Included
- UI automation project files
- Automated UI test scripts
- Supporting configuration and setup files

---

### Notes
- UI automation focuses on core functional scenarios only.
- Mobile application testing is not included.
